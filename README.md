# Cellular-Automata-Demo
A demo of the cellular automata system as used for world generation

implemented in pygame (obviously not a fully correct implementation but you get the idea)

How it works:
    Randomly makes each tile either grass or water
    Checks if the tiles to the left and right of a tile are grass. If the tile is water, it changes to grass
    That's it

Controls:
    ENTER to randomly fill the tiles
    SPACE to check the tiles next to each tile

Hope you learned something i guess
